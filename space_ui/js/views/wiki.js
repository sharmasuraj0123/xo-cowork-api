        row in the List drawer’s Files panel, and “Preview file” in Graph’s
        detail panel. Opening a file does not navigate — the view underneath
        keeps its lens, its scroll and its expansion state, and the drawer’s
        Graph button is the one control that moves you.</p>
        <p>How a file renders is a security contract, not a display
        preference. Markdown goes through the escape-first renderer, which
        escapes the source before it transforms it and emits only fixed,
        attribute-free tags. HTML from disk never enters this document: it
        renders in an iframe with an empty <code>sandbox</code> attribute and
        <code>srcdoc</code>, so it has an opaque origin, no scripts, and no
        network. Everything else shows as escaped source, and a Source toggle
        gives the raw text of any of them. Files in a workspace are agent
        output, and this page holds your session.</p>
        <p class="wiki-note">Backed by
        <code>GET /api/xo-projects/{id}/file?relative_path=…</code>, which
        addresses a file by project id and project-relative path — never an
        absolute host path — with a 256 KB cap and a suffix allowlist. Path
        traversal, an absolute path, and a symlink pointing out of the project
        are all rejected; an unsupported suffix returns 415 and the drawer says

          <p>Run the installer from the directory you want as your

          directory itself becomes your projects root.</p></li>
          <li><b>Run the installer.</b>
          <code>curl -fsSL https://www.quirq.ai/install | sh</code>
          <p>The short URL serves a small POSIX-sh bootstrap: it checks for
          <code>curl</code> and <code>bash</code>, downloads
          <code>install.sh</code> to a temporary file rather than piping it
          into a shell, and runs it under <code>bash</code> — the installer
          proper uses <code>BASH_SOURCE</code> and <code>pipefail</code>. It
          clones the server, prepares the environment, starts the server in the
          foreground, and prints the browser URL.
          <code>QUIRQ_SOURCE_REF=development</code> moves the bootstrap and the
          clone to the same branch. Fetching
          <code>raw.githubusercontent.com/quirq-ai/xo-space/main/install.sh</code>
          and piping that to <code>bash</code> yourself does the same thing.</p></li>

        <h1>How the watcher works</h1>
        <p>The watcher is a configurable, non-fatal projection loop. It can
        tail only the selected runtime or combine every mounted supported
        runtime, converts records into a small event vocabulary, and fans those
        events into independently owned documents.</p>

      <section class="wiki-section">
        <h2>One tick, in order</h2>
        <ol class="wiki-steps">
          <li><b>Drain configured sources.</b><p><code>AGENT_NAME</code>
          still chooses the chat backend. The Setup tab separately chooses
          active-only or all-mounted watcher mode; each source tails native
          files or polls a database and emits normalized events only for
          sessions mapped to XO projects.</p></li>
          <li><b>Refresh the model cache.</b><p><code>UsageObserved</code>
          events update an in-memory session-to-model map. Presence uses this
          map because the activity schema requires an agent/model identity.</p></li>
          <li><b>Group by project.</b><p>Events without a resolved
          <code>project_id</code> do not enter project sinks. This prevents
          unrelated runtime conversations from polluting project history.</p></li>
          <li><b>Run project sinks.</b><p>Identity is filled first; session
          augmentation, todos, stats, and timeline follow. Each sink owns its
          document and uses atomic replacement or append-only JSONL.</p></li>
          <li><b>Refresh presence.</b><p>Every configured source is asked for
          a fresh process snapshot. The loop then runs over every discovered
          project, not only the ones with events this tick: each gets a new
          activity file, even when empty, so exited sessions disappear promptly,
          and each gets an idempotent identity fill so a scaffolded project
          cannot sit on <code>_template: true</code> until its first event.</p></li>
          <li><b>Rebuild workspace views.</b><p>The workspace document is
          rewritten first, then the three Space payloads —
          <code>&lt;XO root&gt;/.xo/space.json</code>,
          <code>dashboard.json</code> and <code>sessions.json</code> — then the
          unions of stats, live activity, sessions and augment data. The payload
          rebuild walks every mapped file in every project, so it throttles
          itself to one pass per <code>XO_VIEWS_REFRESH_S</code> (default 30s);
          a request to <code>/xo/*.json</code> rebuilds a file older than
          <code>XO_VIEW_MAX_AGE_S</code> (default 120s) itself, so those routes
          still answer with the watcher switched off. Timeline events are tagged
          with <code>project_id</code> as they are emitted.</p></li>

          <p>JSON snapshots are written to a temporary sibling, flushed, and
          replaced. Timelines append complete JSON lines. Because both the
          watcher and todo API can update <code>todos.json</code>, they share
          advisory locks under <code>&lt;state root&gt;/watcher/locks/</code> —
          <code>~/.quirq/watcher/locks/</code> unless

          <p><code>QUIRQ_WATCHER_ENABLED</code> (default true) gates the whole

          <code>.xo</code> output and live presence stop being refreshed, and
          the three workspace view files stop being rebuilt on a schedule —
          <code>/xo/*.json</code> then builds each one on demand the first time
          a request finds it missing or older than
          <code>XO_VIEW_MAX_AGE_S</code>. The tick rate is
          <code>QUIRQ_WATCHER_INTERVAL_SECONDS</code> (default 1s, clamped to
          0.25–60) and coverage is <code>QUIRQ_WATCHER_SOURCE_MODE</code>
          (<code>active</code> or <code>all</code>).</p>

          <h2>Failure behavior</h2>
          <p>A source, project sink batch, presence sink, or workspace
          aggregation can fail without stopping FastAPI. The error is logged
          and the next tick retries. Readers therefore need to tolerate a

        <h1>Sessions replayed as light</h1>
        <p>Space Walk is XO Labs’ fork of mindwalk. One Go binary reads
        Claude Code, Codex, and pi session logs, normalizes each into a
        replayable trace, and plays it back as light moving over a 3D map of
        the repository: where the agent searched, read, and edited, the map
        glows — everything else stays dark. Replay is entirely local: no
        service, no account, no telemetry. The one exception is the optional
        judge — when you run it, a summary of that session (task wording, file
        paths, event digests) goes to the model behind your own
        <code>claude</code> or <code>codex</code> CLI, and spends real tokens
        against that provider.</p>

        <h2>One trace, whatever the harness</h2>
        <p>Every adapter implements the same five-method
        <code>adapter.Source</code> interface — Harness, SessionDir,
        ListSessions, Summarize, Parse — and emits the same trace shape:
        <code>{version, session, events, marks, stats}</code>. An event is one
        tool call joined with its result: <code>seq</code>, <code>ts</code>,
        <code>tool</code>, <code>action</code>, <code>targets</code>,
        <code>resultBytes</code>, <code>isError</code>,
        <code>outcomeKnown</code>, <code>outside</code>, and
        <code>summary</code>, where the action is one of
        <code>search</code>, <code>read</code>,
        <code>edit</code>, <code>exec</code>, <code>verify</code>, or
        <code>other</code>. Shell commands classify conservatively: substrings
        like <code>pytest</code>, <code>go test</code>, and
        <code>npm run build</code> mean verify; anything unrecognized stays
        exec.</p>
        <p>Each target carries a touch state on a strict lattice —
        <b>edit &gt; read &gt; hit</b> — and a file only ever escalates during
        playback: a later read never downgrades an earlier edit. Marks record
        what happened between events: user messages (the note keeps up to
        2,000 runes of text), context compactions, and subagent launches.</p>

        <p class="wiki-note">The trace grades its own observability per
        session, not per harness: claude-code and pi carry structural error
        flags and grade exact, but one event whose outcome the log leaves
        unknown downgrades that whole session to estimated; codex, whose
        failures are inferred from output text, is always estimated. The HUD
        shows a tilde instead of hiding the difference.</p>

        olive, steel, and lime differ in lightness as well as hue, and rust is
        reserved for error so no data state can be mistaken for trouble. These
        are deliberately <em>not</em> the raw xo-space brand tokens — fed to a
        five-check validator as a categorical set against the night sky, the
        brand greens land at ΔE 11.1 for normal vision against a floor of 15,
        meaning seen and edited blur together even with full color vision. The
        shipped triad clears that gate at ΔE 17.4 normal and 16.1 under
        simulated deuteranopia; the run and its thresholds are recorded in the
        fork at <code>docs/palette-validation.md</code>. Every swatch clears
        3:1 against the <code>#0b0c0f</code> sky;
        <code>--touch-hit</code> measures 3.3:1 there, so it is a fill color,
        not a small-text color.</p>

        <h2>Space Walk in the quirq program</h2>
        <p>The quirq calculus prices a unit of work u = (S₀, G, τ, B): commit
        a before-state, a weighted check battery, a threshold, and a budget,
        then score only the captured after-state S₁. Assumption A2 is that checks
        read captured state only, never the worker’s transcript — which is
        exactly why traces matter here: a trace can never be a check, which
        makes it the natural audit-evidence layer for the gold-score sampling
        §4.8 uses to estimate its gaps. That pairing is this wiki’s proposal,
        not a dependency the whitepaper already has. A trace carries
        <code>session.cwd</code> and <code>session.commit</code>, so sessions
        join deterministically to a repository and to tag-delimited unit
        windows. The recipes below pair Space Walk with the quirq
        calculator’s git observation API; quirq’s machine-local watcher state
        is a different layer.</p>

        reads them for geometry — neither writes them. Compare machine-local
        watcher state with portable .xo outputs side by side in the Quirq
