# Install and run Quirq

Pick a directory to keep Quirq in, then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quirq-ai/xo-space/main/install.sh | bash
```

Open <http://localhost:5002/space/>.

Docker is not required. The command:

1. installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if it is missing;
2. clones Quirq into `./xo-space`, named after the repository;
3. creates `./xo-space/venv` with Python 3.12, downloading an interpreter if
   the host has none, and installs `requirements.txt`;
4. creates `./.quirq`, and treats the current directory as your projects root;
5. reports which optional tools are present; and
6. starts the server in the foreground and prints the URL.

Press Ctrl-C to stop it. Run the same command again to update and restart.

It must be piped to `bash`, not `sh` — the script uses `BASH_SOURCE` and
`set -o pipefail`, neither of which exists in POSIX `sh`.

## Prerequisites

`git` is required: Quirq uses it to download itself, and at runtime for project
sync and history.

Everything else is optional. The script prints a readiness table at startup
naming what each missing tool costs you:

| Tool | Used for |
|---|---|
| `node`, `npm` | installing the agent CLI |
| `gh` | xo-projects-sync backup repositories |
| `rclone` | Google Drive and OneDrive connectors |
| `gpg` | encrypted backup and restore |

Nothing here is fatal. A missing tool disables its feature and nothing else.

## The agent CLI

Quirq does not install anything beyond `requirements.txt`. It runs on your own
machine, so it will not `apt-get`, pipe an installer to your shell, or
`npm install -g` behind your back.

That means you install the agent CLI yourself, once:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

To opt back into the automatic bootstrap — apt packages, Node via nvm, and the
CLI — start with `QUIRQ_SKIP_BOOT_INSTALL=0`.

## Local data

Everything lives under the directory you launched from, so an install is
self-contained and you can move or delete it as one folder.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.` | Your projects root — each project is a subdirectory with its own `.xo` |
| `./xo-space` | The Quirq source checkout |
| `./xo-space/venv` | Python environment |
| `./.quirq` | Runtime configuration, saved credentials, watcher activity, cursors, locks, and other machine-local state |

Open the **Setup** tab after installation. It shows the paths in use, CLI
readiness, native session file counts, the active chat backend, and the watcher
source mode and tick interval. It also lets you configure a different XO
projects root and `.quirq` state root.

The Setup tab cannot restart the server for you — nothing supervises the
process. When it reports that a restart is required, press Ctrl-C and run the
command again.

## Running from a clone

If you already have a checkout, run the script from inside it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quirq-ai/xo-space
cd xo-space
./install.sh
```

It detects the checkout, uses that working tree in place, and never runs a git
command against it — your local edits are left alone. In this mode
the repository itself becomes the projects root and `./.quirq` is created
inside it. Both are already in `.gitignore`.

## Configuration

Every value is overridable from the environment:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | `5002` |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `XO_PROJECTS_ROOT` | the launch directory |
| `QUIRQ_STATE_ROOT` | `./.quirq` |
| `QUIRQ_APP_DIR` | `./xo-space` |
| `QUIRQ_SOURCE_REF` | `main` |
| `AGENT_NAME` | `claude_code` |
| `QUIRQ_SKIP_BOOT_INSTALL` | `1` |

For example:

```bash
curl -fsSL <url>/install.sh | PORT=8080 XO_PROJECTS_ROOT=/absolute/path bash
```

On first run the installer writes `quirq/.env` recording exactly what it used,
then never rewrites it — it is yours to edit. Change a value there and re-run
`./install.sh` to apply it. Credentials are written commented out; uncomment
the ones you need, or configure them through the Setup tab instead.

Precedence, highest first:

1. variables exported in your shell — `PORT=8080 ./install.sh`
2. `quirq/.env`
3. the defaults above

The Setup tab's `runtime.env` and `secrets.env` are loaded with `override=True`
and beat all three, so the tab stays authoritative for whatever it manages.

Roots are also read from `roots.env` in the state root, which the Setup tab
writes. Explicit environment variables take precedence over it.

Quirq refuses to start if the projects root and state root are nested inside
one another, or if the checkout sits inside the state root — relocating the
state root copies it wholesale, and it must not drag a checkout or your
projects along.

The one exception is the default layout: the state root may be a *hidden*
directory directly inside the projects root, as `./.quirq` is. Project
enumeration skips dot-prefixed entries, so it can never be mistaken for a
project. A visible `./quirq` state root, or one nested deeper, is still
rejected.

## Windows

Not supported. The server's boot hooks are bash scripts, and while they fail
non-fatally, no equivalent installer exists. Use WSL.
