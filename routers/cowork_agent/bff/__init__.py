"""BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) layer.

Intent-named endpoints that wrap the OS-direct routes under
``/api/files/*`` with curated, filtered responses. The frontend talks
to these routes in nouns (projects, secrets) and never sees raw
filesystem paths.

See docs/bff-endpoints-design.md for the design rules. The aggregator
below is consumed by the parent package's ``all_routers`` so
``server.py`` picks the routes up at mount time.
