"""Router aggregation for the cowork_agent subpackage.

Each route module exposes a single `router: APIRouter`. `all_routers` is the
ordered list `server.py` uses to mount them onto the FastAPI app.

Migrated from bridge/routes/__init__.py on 2026-04-20. Bridge's health route
is intentionally not migrated (xo-cowork-api's existing /health stays).
