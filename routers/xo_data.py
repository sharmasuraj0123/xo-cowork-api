"""``/xo/*.json`` — the workspace ``.xo`` directory, served.

Space's data lives in one location on disk: ``~/xo-projects/.xo/``. These
routes are the browser's door to that directory, and the URL mirrors the path
one for one — ``GET /xo/space.json`` is ``<XO root>/.xo/space.json``. Nothing
is generated per request and nothing is served out of ``space_ui/data``; the
watcher materialises the files (see visualizer/workspace/views.py) and this
router hands them over.

Deliberately an allowlist, not a static mount of the directory. ``.xo`` also
holds the capability manifest, the session index and the workspace timeline;
exposing the whole folder over HTTP because three files in it are wanted is a
bigger decision than this change needs to make.

A file that is missing, empty or older than ``XO_VIEW_MAX_AGE_S`` is rebuilt
in a worker thread and written back, so the answer a client gets and the file
on disk never diverge — and so the UI still works with the watcher disabled.
