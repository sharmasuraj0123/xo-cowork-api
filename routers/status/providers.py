"""
Providers status API router.

Reports connection state (OAuth + API key) for every model provider that is
``enabled: true`` in xo.json's ``models`` section. Dispatches on
``AGENT_NAME`` because each agent has its own env source for API keys, even
though the OAuth probes (claude / codex) are agent-independent.

Disabled providers are omitted from the response entirely — the frontend
drives section visibility off xo.json's `enabled` flags, so this endpoint
only reports on what is in scope to render. ``connected: false`` therefore
always means "enabled but not authenticated", never "disabled in manifest".

Unlike ``/models/status`` and ``/channels/status`` this result is **not**
mirrored into xo.json: connection state can flip between probes (the user
runs ``claude auth login``, edits .env, etc.), so we keep it live-only.
