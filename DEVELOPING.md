# Developing xo-cowork-api

A practical guide to working in this codebase: how it's wired, where things
live, how to run and validate it, and how to add a new agent backend without
touching core code.

## 1. The mental model: a dumb broker + pluggable agents

`xo-cowork-api` is a **broker**. Core code knows how to chat, list sessions,
report usage, and serve status — but it never knows *which* agent backend it is
talking to. Everything agent-specific is resolved at runtime from a single env
var, **`AGENT_NAME`**, and lives in two predictable places per agent.

There are two deliberately separate execution **planes**. Keep them apart.

| | Plane A — legacy direct CLI | Plane B — the modular agent system |
|---|---|---|
| Entry points | `/ask_question`, `/ask_question_streaming` | `/api/chat/*` and the rest of `/api/*` |
| Selected by | `AI_PROVIDER=claude\|codex` | `AGENT_NAME=openclaw\|claude_code\|hermes\|…` |
| Code | `config/models/<name>/client.py` | `services/cowork_agent/adapters/<name>/` |
| Instantiated | once as `ai_client` in `server.py` | per request via the capability loader |
| Status | frozen, backward-compatible | where all new work happens |

Codex is **only** a Plane-A model client (no adapter). Plane A never routes
through the dispatcher; Plane B never touches `/ask_question`.

## 2. Repository layout

The **only** two trees an agent author touches are `config/agents/<name>/` and
`services/cowork_agent/adapters/<name>/`. (`config/models/<name>/` is the
Plane-A equivalent.) Everything else is framework.

## 3. How dispatch works (Plane B)

### 3.1 Resolving the active agent

`services/cowork_agent/registry/agent_registry.py` discovers every
`config/agents/<name>/manifest.json` at startup and resolves the active one:

1. `AGENT_NAME` env var (runtime override), else
2. `DEFAULT_AGENT` env var (baseline), else
3. if exactly one manifest exists, use it, else
4. fall back to **`openclaw`** with a warning (a deliberate safe-boot default so
   the server starts with no env configured), else raise.

`get_active_agent()` returns the active `AgentManifest`; `all_agents()` returns
all of them.

### 3.2 The capability loader — the one seam

Everything agent-specific is reached through **one** function:

```python
from services.cowork_agent.adapters.loader import load_capability, try_load_capability

mod = load_capability("usage")            # imports adapters/<active>/usage.py (raises if missing)
mod = try_load_capability("chat")         # same, but returns None if the agent lacks it
mod = load_capability("usage", agent="hermes")   # target a specific agent
```

A **capability** is just a module `adapters/<name>/<capability>.py`. A core
router asks for a capability and forwards to it; it never branches on the agent
name. A missing capability is normal — the router returns its empty/501 shape.

Capabilities in use today:

| capability | what it provides | openclaw | claude_code | hermes | antigravity |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `adapter` | the `Adapter` class (run/stream dispatch) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `usage` | `/api/usage` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `models` | `/api/models` listing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `models_status` | `/models/status` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `channels_status` | `/channels/status` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `providers_status` | `/providers/status` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `sessions` | session read/convert | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `chat` | `resolve_agent_id` / `handle_prompt` (optional) | ✓ | — | ✓ | — |
| `streaming` | SSE shaping | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `visualizer_source` | visualizer feed | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `routes` | agent-owned `APIRouter` (active-only) | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |

`claude_code` has no `chat` capability on purpose: `routers/cowork_agent/chat.py`
falls through to the shared `AgentDispatcher` when `chat`/`handle_prompt` is
absent. "Capability absent ⇒ graceful default" is the whole design.

### 3.3 The dispatch adapter (`adapter` capability)

`adapters/<name>/adapter.py` exposes `Adapter`, a subclass of
[`BaseAgentAdapter`](services/cowork_agent/adapters/base.py):

- **abstract:** `run(question, session_id, **kw)`, `stream(...)`, and the
  `adapter_name` property.
- **concrete (override as needed):** `setup()`, `health()`, `load_commands()`.

`services/cowork_agent/registry/adapter_registry.py` instantiates it via
`get_adapter(name, config)` and **auto-discovers** adapters by scanning for
`adapters/<name>/adapter.py` (`list_adapters()`). There is **no** hand-maintained
registry dict.

### 3.4 Agent-owned routes

Endpoints that exist only for one agent (e.g. hermes profile management) live in
`adapters/<name>/routes.py` as a `router: APIRouter`. `_active_agent_routes()` in
`routers/cowork_agent/__init__.py` mounts it **only when that agent is active**.
This is why per-agent route counts differ (see §5).

## 4. Adding a new agent — "drop two folders"

No core file changes. To add agent `foo`:

1. **`config/agents/foo/manifest.json`** — `name`, `binary`, `home_dir`,
   `env_file`, `config_file`, `agents_dir`, `api` block, `commands` templates,
   `providers`/`channels` recipes. (Copy an existing manifest and adjust.)
2. **`config/agents/foo/capabilities.json`** — the Models/Data/Channels/Secrets
   UI flags that drive `xo.json`.
3. **`services/cowork_agent/adapters/foo/adapter.py`** — `class FooAdapter(BaseAgentAdapter)`
   implementing `run`/`stream`/`adapter_name`, then `Adapter = FooAdapter`.
4. Add only the capabilities you need (`usage.py`, `models.py`, `sessions.py`,
   `routes.py`, …). Skip the rest — their endpoints degrade to empty/501.
5. (Optional) `settings.sh`/`agent.sh`/`troubleshoot.py` for setup + lifecycle.

Run with `AGENT_NAME=foo python server.py` and validate (§5), then confirm you
didn't leak the agent name into core (the modularity invariant, §6).

---

## 5. Running & validating

The project venv is `venv/bin/python` (it has fastapi/uvicorn; the system
`python3` does not).

```bash
# Run
python server.py                                   # http://localhost:5002
uvicorn server:app --port 5002 --reload            # dev auto-reload
AGENT_NAME=hermes python server.py                 # boot a specific backend
```

**Validation playbook — run before every commit:**

```bash
# 1. Import gate + route parity under each agent (expect 146 / 149 / 173 / 148)
for a in claude_code openclaw hermes antigravity; do
  AGENT_NAME=$a venv/bin/python -c "import server; \
    print('$a', len(server.app.openapi()['paths']))"
done

# 2. Modularity invariant (§6) — no agent name in core code. Upheld in review;
#    a local AST guard can verify it if you have it (kept out of the repo, §6).

# 3. Smoke where data exists: list_models() per agent; /api/usage,
#    /models/status, /channels/status, /providers/status, /api/sessions non-5xx
#    (501 only where a capability is intentionally absent).
```

Per-agent route counts differ by design (the route de-leak): non-hermes agents
don't carry the `/api/channels/hermes/*` and `/api/config/hermes*` routes.

---

## 6. The modularity invariant

**No core file may name a specific agent (`openclaw`/`hermes`/`claude_code`) in
code.** Core is everything except the three agent-owned trees:
`services/cowork_agent/adapters/<name>/`, `config/agents/<name>/`, and
`config/models/<name>/`. Agent names may appear in those trees only; everywhere
else, resolve by `AGENT_NAME` through the capability loader.

The rule is upheld in review. A small documented allowlist covers four frozen
exceptions:

- the `openclaw` safe-boot default in `agent_registry.py`,
- the `/providers/status` OAuth keys (`claude_code`/`codex`) in `providers_status_lib.py`,
- the legacy `/openclaw/usage` URL alias in `routers/cowork_agent/legacy/openclaw_usage.py`,
- codex's legacy openclaw-gateway credential writes in `routers/auth/codex_setup.py`.

> An AST-based guard for this invariant (ignores docstrings/comments and
> `config.models.*` imports) is kept as local dev tooling, not committed. If you
> have it, run it after touching core; otherwise verify the rule by hand against
> the allowlist above.

## 7. Conventions

- **Thin routers, logic in services.** Endpoints live in `routers/` via
  `APIRouter`; business logic lives in `services/`. `server.py` is the only file
  that wires both planes.
- **Backward compatibility is sacred.** Don't change any endpoint path, request
  schema, or response shape without an explicit ask. Behavior-preserving moves
  over rewrites.
- **The project folder is sacred.** Never write chat content, credentials, or
  anything that wouldn't survive a `git push` into `~/xo-projects/<id>/`. Chat
  content stays in each runtime's own home (`~/.claude/`, `~/.openclaw/`, …).
- **Async** for all network/subprocess work. **Never log** tokens or secrets.
- One concern per commit; validate (§5) before each.

---

## 8. Recent cleanup (2026-06-08)

The agent-modular refactor was finished and tidied:

- **`config/models/` reorg** — model clients moved into per-model folders:
  `claude_code/client.py` and `codex/client.py` (was flat
  `claude_code_client.py` / `codex_code_client.py`).
- **De-branched shared code** — `skill_installer.py` now resolves install
  targets from each manifest's `home_dir` (was hardcoded `~/.claude`/`~/.openclaw`);
  the `connect/claude-code` and `connect/codex` auth routers write the token to the
  active agent's `env_file` (was hardcoded `~/.openclaw/.env`). Codex's
  openclaw-gateway config writes are intentionally left (old but needed; schema
  is openclaw-specific) and allowlisted.
- **Dead code removed** — the unused `seed_openclaw_status` alias.
- **Modularity invariant documented** — §6 codifies "no agent name in core
  code"; a local AST guard (kept out of the repo) can check it.

Full record: `docs/refactor/STATUS.md` and `HANDOFF.md` (local).
