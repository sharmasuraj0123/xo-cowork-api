# install.sh — set up and run Quirq natively, without Docker.
#
# Replaces the previous Docker installer. Instead of pulling an image
# and `docker run`ing it, this prepares a virtual environment with uv
# and runs `server.py` directly in the foreground, the way you would
# during normal local development. Docker Desktop is no longer a
# prerequisite; git and a network connection are.
#
# Two ways to use it, chosen automatically:
#
#   From a checkout — uses that working tree in place and never runs
#   a git command against it, so your local edits stay yours:
#       git clone https://github.com/quirq-ai/xo-space
#       cd xo-space && ./install.sh
#
#   Standalone — clones into ./<repo-name> and runs from there.
#   Re-running fast-forwards that checkout, so this doubles as the
#   update path:
#       curl -fsSL <raw-url>/install.sh | bash
#
# The directory you launch from becomes the workspace: the checkout
# lands beside your projects, and machine state goes in ./.quirq
#
# The server runs in the foreground with a quiet terminal: its output
# appends to <state root>/quirq.log, Ctrl-C stops it, and re-running
# updates and restarts. Agents wanting a session-scoped background server
# run this same command as a background task of their harness — process
# lifecycle belongs to whoever launched it, so there is no daemon mode,
# no PID file, and no stop subcommand.
#
# Root directory precedence:
#     XO_PROJECTS_ROOT / QUIRQ_STATE_ROOT exported in the caller's shell
#         → roots.env saved by the Setup tab
#         → the checkout's .env from the first install
#         → the launch directory, and ./.quirq inside it
#
# Every environment value below is overridable from the caller's
# environment, e.g.  PORT=8080 ./install.sh
#
# Note it must be piped to `bash`, not `sh`: it uses BASH_SOURCE and
# `set -o pipefail`, neither of which exists in POSIX sh (dash).

#       default to false, so the Setup tab correctly reports that
#       it cannot restart this process instead of offering a
#       control that would fail.
#
# AGENT_NAME defaults to claude_code here, where the Docker installer
# left it unset. Without it the server still boots — agent_registry safe-boots
# to openclaw — but _run_agent_setup reads AGENT_NAME directly with no
# fallback, so nothing would install a CLI and no backend would work.
# Setting it makes the Docker-free path self-sufficient on first run.
# It stays overridable, and runtime.env (loaded with override=True)
# still wins, so the Setup tab remains authoritative.

#
# which matches how the server itself loads it: python-dotenv's plain
# load_dotenv() fills only what the environment left unset. The Setup tab's
# runtime.env and secrets.env are loaded with override=True and beat all
# three, so the tab stays authoritative for anything it manages.
