"""``~/xo-projects/.xo/{space,dashboard,sessions}.json`` — the Space data files.

These three used to exist only as route responses, rebuilt per request behind a
30s in-process cache. Now they are real files in the workspace ``.xo``
directory, next to the rest of the workspace's state: one location that holds
everything, materialised by the watcher and read by the routes.

Each file keeps its own name and its own schema — a reader that wants the
session telemetry does not parse the 168 KB graph to get it.

Cadence: the views walk every mapped file in every project, so they are rebuilt
at most every ``XO_VIEWS_REFRESH_S`` (default 30s — the freshness the routes
already served). The watcher tick runs inside ``asyncio.to_thread``
(watcher.run), so that walk never blocks the event loop.

Each view is built under its own guard: a failing session-telemetry provider
must not cost the graph its refresh, and a failed rebuild leaves the previous
file in place rather than truncating it. Stale beats absent — a route can say
how old a file is, it cannot invent one.

The two projections come from ONE scan. ``build_categorized_graph`` used to
call ``build_space_data`` itself, so a client that opened Dashboard and Graph
paid for two full workspace walks.
