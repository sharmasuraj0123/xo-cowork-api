"""``~/xo-projects/.xo/timeline.jsonl`` — multiplexed workspace
timeline.

Different from the other workspace sinks: timeline is **append-only**
at both tiers, so we don't union the files on every tick (that
would re-append duplicates). Instead the watcher's main loop emits
workspace events alongside per-project events on a per-tick basis,
appending the SAME events to the workspace file with an extra
``project_id`` field.

This module provides the append helper; the watcher loop calls it
directly with the per-tick event list and a project_id tag.
