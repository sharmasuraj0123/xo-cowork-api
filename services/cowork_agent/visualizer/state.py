"""Watcher-owned state directory.

Adapter sources that need to persist their own cursors (e.g. a
SQLite-polling source tracking the last-seen row id per session)
should put their files under :func:`watcher_state_dir`, not construct
the path themselves. This keeps the watcher's filesystem layout an
implementation detail the adapter doesn't need to know.

The dir is also where ``ingest.jsonl_tail.OffsetStore`` keeps its
file offsets (``offsets.json``), so adapter cursor files, the shared
offset store, and ephemeral live-presence snapshots live side by side
— one ``~/.quirq/watcher/`` to clean if you ever want to fully reset
watcher state.
