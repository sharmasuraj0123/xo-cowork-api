"""
Per-request identity for Composio.

Two distinct things travel through this module, and conflating them is the bug
this design exists to prevent:

- an **account id** — what XO's ``/get-user-id`` returns. Every workspace an XO
  account owns resolves to the same value.
- a **principal** — the account id composed with the workspace id by
  ``services.tenancy``. This is the Composio tenant key.

The invariant: *stored and in-process state stays keyed by the bare account id;
anything crossing the pod boundary is scoped.* So ``_TOKEN_CACHE`` below and
``session_identity`` both hold account ids, and composition happens once, at
read, in :func:`resolve_user_from_bearer`. Do not "fix" those to store
principals — a single composition point is what makes double-scoping impossible.
