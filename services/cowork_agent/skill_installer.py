"""
Bundled-skill installer.

Copies skills shipped with this repo into the on-disk skill directory of every
installed agent. Runs at server startup. Non-fatal on missing parents or write
errors — matches the rclone/usage-sync bootstrap pattern in server.py.

Install targets are resolved from each discovered agent manifest's ``home_dir``
(no backend name is hardcoded here): a skill lands in ``<home_dir>/skills/<name>``
for every agent whose home dir exists on the host.

``link_global_skill()`` applies the same target rule to skills installed
universally by ``npx skills add -g`` (under ``~/.agents/skills/``), symlinking
them into every installed agent — including agents the skills CLI cannot
auto-detect.

    manifest sets `precreate_home_for_skills`, its home is created when

    Symlink a universally installed skill into every installed agent's skill dir.

    ``npx skills add -g`` writes the canonical copy to ``~/.agents/skills/<name>``

    heard of get nothing. This walks every discovered manifest and creates
    ``<home_dir>/skills/<name>`` → the canonical copy, for agents whose home
    dir already exists — a missing home means that CLI isn't installed, and a
    home is never created here. Idempotent: an existing entry — the skills
    CLI's own symlink or a real directory — is left untouched; only a dangling
    symlink is replaced. Symlinks are relative, matching the skills CLI's own
    convention.
