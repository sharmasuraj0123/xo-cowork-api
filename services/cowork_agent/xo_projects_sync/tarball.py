"""
Tar.gz building + extraction for project snapshots.

Two decisions worth understanding before editing:

1. **How `.gitignore` is honoured.** If the project is a git repo (has
   a `.git/` directory) we defer to `git ls-files --cached --others
   --exclude-standard` for the inclusion list. That gives us exact
   gitignore semantics (negation, `**`, nested ignore files) without
   pulling in a dependency. If the project is NOT a git repo, we walk
   the tree and apply only the mandatory-exclude list below — the
   user's own `.gitignore` is silently ignored in that case. Document
   this clearly so users who care about size will `git init` their
   project.

2. **Mandatory excludes always apply.** Even inside a git repo where
   `node_modules/` is tracked (uncommon but valid), we still skip
   secrets and build artefacts at backup time. The blob is encrypted
   but a leaked passphrase shouldn't also leak `.env`. The list lives
   here as `MANDATORY_EXCLUDE_NAMES` / `MANDATORY_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS`;
   keep them in sync with the design doc.
