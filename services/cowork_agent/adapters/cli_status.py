"""
Shared CLI invocation for the per-agent status adapters.

The openclaw / claude_code / hermes status adapters all shell out to a CLI and
then interpret its output. The *invocation* half is identical across them —
resolve the binary, guard a missing absolute path, spawn, enforce a timeout
(killing the process on expiry), and decode stdout/stderr. The *interpretation*
half differs per agent (strict JSON vs. text parse vs. gateway-down fallback,
and which ``invalid_*`` code to raise), so it stays in each adapter.

This module owns only the invocation half:

    resolve_binary(env_var, default_bin) -> str
    run_cli(binary, args, *, timeout, label) -> CliResult

``run_cli`` raises :class:`CliStatusError` for ``binary_not_found`` / ``timeout``
(the cases that are identical everywhere) and otherwise returns a
:class:`CliResult`. It deliberately does **not** judge the return code or parse
output — each adapter keeps its own short tail for that, preserving its exact
error code and detail string.

``label`` is the binary's display noun (the agent's CLI command name) and is
used only to keep error *messages* identical to the pre-extraction text.
