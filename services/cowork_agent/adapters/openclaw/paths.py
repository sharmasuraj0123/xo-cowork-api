"""
OpenClaw on-disk layout + API config constants, sourced from the openclaw
manifest (``get_agent("openclaw")``).

These were historically defined in ``services.cowork_agent.settings`` as
``OPENCLAW_*`` / ``AGENTS_DIR``; they live here now so the agent-specific
resolution sits in the openclaw adapter, not in core. ``settings`` re-exports
the same names for backward compatibility, so existing
``from ...settings import AGENTS_DIR`` consumers keep working unchanged.

They are anchored to the openclaw manifest **specifically** (not the active
agent): every consumer is openclaw-specific and must always see openclaw paths
regardless of ``AGENT_NAME``. Code that needs the *active* agent's manifest
calls ``get_active_agent()``.
